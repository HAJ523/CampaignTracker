# Welcome to Campaign Tracker
The goal of Campaign Tracker is to provide tools which can be used by a GM/DM to organize & run their preferred pen and paper role-playing game from a single application. To get started just create a new page and begin exploring the features on your own or read about the features available using the tools integrated documentation.

## Journal
The journal uses markdown text to create wiki style pages which can be traversed and edited on the fly to make not only finding the information you need but to allow for easy editing of those articles to include information which is happening right now.

### Notes
Many games require a method of keeping track of disposable notes or maybe you want to keep your session notes open constantly while the game is running instead of needing to navigate to that page every few minutes to update it.

### Music
This application allows for music and sound effects to be played directly. With volume controls and automatic cross-fading for repeated effects.

### Dice
If you find yourself needing to roll many dice or just want to speed up your game by creating dice macros ahead of time you can setup dice to be rolled directly from the journal pages you are creating or roll freely using the "Free Roll" text entry.

## Map Maker
Not all GMs/DMs are similar wizards with the paint brush as they are with weaving stories. To help with this Campaign Tracker provides tools for creating old school ASCII rogue-like style maps with the Map Maker.

## Encounters
Once you've made a map you might wonder what to do with it and this is where the Encounters functionality comes in allowing you to place objects, creatures, and players on the map with fog of war allowing you to easily see what the players see as they peak around that corner.



#Journal Markdown
Campaign Tracker uses markdown to transform the text you type into a lively HTML page with formatting. Markdown was selected because it provides the simplest and easiest to understand view in both its original form and relatively simple encoding to HTML for speed, allowing it to be transformed real-time. The following text will give you an idea of what markdown is available and any special features which have been added to make tracking and running a pen and paper RPG from the Campaign Tracker as easy as possible.
## Headers
Headers come in 6 flavors to allow you to distinguish between different sections of the text you are writing. Headers use the `#` symbol as their key and the number of `#` the precede the text determines the level of the header with more `#` meaning a smaller or more sub heading.

Examples: `# Header 1`, `## Header 2`, `### Header 3`, `#### Header 4`, `##### Header 5`, `###### Header 6`
## Text Format
While headers are nice for giving the user a sense of separation between blocks of text it is sometimes necessary to give even **more** emphasis to individual elements of a particular line of text. These designators must appear on a single line of text. Which means if you wish to modify multiple paragraphs you will need to surround every line with the appropriate symbols.
| Type | Markdown |
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Bold**|`&ast;&ast;Bolded Text&ast;&ast;`|
|*Italic*|`&ast;Italic Text&ast;`|
|__Underlined__|`&lowbar;&lowbar;Underlined Text&lowbar;&lowbar;`|
|~~Strike Through~~|`&tilde;&tilde;Struck Text&tilde;&tilde;`|
|`Inline-Code`|`&grave;Code&grave;`|
##Tables
Speaking of formats check out that table above! Created with markdown text these tables provide a way to organize data on a page like nothing else. Take a look at this example below. (Note: The only tricky thing about tables is the column alignment which is specified in the second row of the markdown. In the example below the columns would be left, center, then right aligned.)
```
| Header | Header | Header |
|:--|:--:|--:|
||||
||||
||||

```
##Lists
Lists can be useful not just for shopping or TODO but to keep track of ordered or un-ordered things. Lists can start with either `*` or `-` for un-ordered versions or `+` if you really want to get the Count von Count involved.
*They even allow
 +Nesting of different types
  *Within one another!
 * You can even start a new type if you want
 +Even if you start counting then stop again.
 +Note that counting will only occur if you manage 2 or more in a row.
## Horizontal Separator
Look through the list of headers and individual text but need something just a little different; then the horizontal separator might be just what you need!
---
This fast acting separator can give you the divide you need in your text simply by adding `---` on a line by itself!
##Quotations
Sometimes you need to give text a full and distinct appearance. Especially if this is something that was copied from somewhere else!
> Thankfully, blockqoutes can do just that.
>
> In addition they can be combined with other forms of markdown to produce unique results.
##Code Blocks
Code blocks like in-line code designations force the text that is contain in them to be of uniform width. However they have additional functionality in that they will keep the formatting of additional added lines between the beginning and ending entries.
```
Like, Wow I can add blank lines!

You sure can!
```
Both code blocks and inline-code have single click copy functionality. Meaning when you click on a block the text within is copied to the clip board. This can be useful for creating templates for later use!
##Links
Links come in a variety of formats and do a small variety of different things. They allow execution of the campaign trackers embedded functions like dice rolling and calculation. And they allow you to jump easily from one page to the next with the correct syntax. (Note: The format used for links differs from the standard markdown format to make the inclusion of links by typing into a page a little more straight forward. In addition some of the features like Title to URL linking are note included.)
###Page Links
Page links are the simplest of the different link types. they allow you to specify another page which you want to have access to. The full format for a link `&lbrack;Parent Page/Little Baby Page&rbrack;(URL Title)`. Not all of the elements are necessary you can create a link by just including the section between the brackets. The URL will replace fully the value specified in the href of the link allowing you to access any custom functions you have installed. In addition the Title in the link will change the text which is visible when you mouse over the link.
###Dice Roller
The dice roller feature allows you to setup rolling directly in the page you are viewing. while they will look like other page links they will replace the text visible once you have clicked them with a fresh roll. `?&lbrack;+5]` or `?&lbrack;(1d2!)d20]` The first example will roll the campaign selected default die with the modifier provided. The second will roll 1d2 exploding then roll that many d20.

TODO future examples of all things the dice roller is capable of. Including tables when they are added!
###Calculator
While rolling dice is nice sometimes you need a way to keep track of the value of something over a longer period but it isn't necessarily something that you want to keep editing the page itself. Using the calculator you can assign a value to the link then modify it on the fly by clicking it again and providing a new value or text like +5 to add 5 or -9 to subtract 9. you can add a calculator like this `&&lbrack;Initial Equation]` and the initial equation will determine the starting value for it!
## Images
Images can be very helpful in directing player attention as such it can be important to not only add them to your notes but provide a method to show them to your players. Images will load to the page inline with other text and when clicked on they will maximize to take up as much of the screen as possible. Any remaining area will be blacked out. Clicking on the image again will bring you back to the previous view. Images can be referenced like `!&lbrack;Local Image Location](full-image-location title)`. (Note that like links the only portion image specification that is required is the portion between the brackets.)
