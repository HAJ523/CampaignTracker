| Music & Effects | Mute needs to correctly adjust volume. or use howler mute.
| Mapper | Tools menu is too long. While having titles between things is nice it ruins the flow of the page. Replace layers with selection for All, & individual layers. Update Palette editing to happen in modal. |
| StatusBar | Correct the sizes of font / bar so that the highlighted sidebar tab selection fills to bottom bar.
| Music & Effects | Pause/Play needs to correctly select when new music is started so you don't have to click it twice to pause.

| Sidebar | ALL | Allow toggling between music, page view, player list, turn order "tabs"
| Journal | Embed | Add the ability for users to specify an embedded text to send to the status window. allow this text to contain inline rolls.
| Journal | Code | Add the ability for custom javascript to be added to a page to affect the global context or to add page specific variables.
| Mapper | Fill Tool | A user should be able to fill a section of the map like they painted every cell by hand. (Will need to determine if the fill will happen on an enclosed space or limit spread of fill based on painting size.)
| Mapper | Layers | Make tools respect layers editing so that existing tiles only have modified the visible layers.
