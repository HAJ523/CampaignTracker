# Issues
 | Group | Issue |
 |:--:|:--|
 | Mapper | Tools menu is too long. While having titles between things is nice it ruins the flow of the page. Replace layers with selection for All, & individual layers. Update Palette editing to happen in modal. |
 | Encounter | Tools menu is too long. Move objects and Creatures editing / creation into modal, Remove title groupings. Merge show and hide / FOW options in single selects where possible. |

# Enhancements
 | Group | Name | Story |
 |:--:|:--:|:--|
 | Encounter | Objects & Effects | A user should be able to add objects to an encounter of different types and should be able to add effects to those objects like light, terrain, occlusion.
 | Mapper | Fill Tool | A user should be able to fill a section of the map like they painted every cell by hand. (Will need to determine if the fill will happen on an enclosed space or limit spread of fill based on painting size.)
 | Mapper | Default Palettes | There should be a list of default palettes to make the start of mapping easier.
 | Mapper | UI | Update all UI buttons to use less HTML elements / Selects instead of custom functionality.
 | Mapper | Layers | Make tools respect layers editing so that existing tiles only have modified the visible layers.
