| Mapper | Tools menu is too long. While having titles between things is nice it ruins the flow of the page. Replace layers with selection for All, & individual layers. Update Palette editing to happen in modal. |
| StatusBar | Correct the sizes of font / bar so that the highlighted sidebar tab selection fills to bottom bar.

| Mapper | Fill Tool | A user should be able to fill a section of the map like they painted every cell by hand. (Will need to determine if the fill will happen on an enclosed space or limit spread of fill based on painting size.)
| Mapper | Layers | Make tools respect layers editing so that existing tiles only have modified the visible layers.
